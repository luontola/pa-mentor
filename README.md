PA Mentor
=========

[Planetary Annihilation](http://www.uberent.com/pa/) mod showing how your
in-game stats compare to other players, to help in learning how fast and
how much to expand your economy and production. The statistics are based on
the data collected by [PA Stats](http://www.nanodesu.info/pastats/).

Building
--------

Uses [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) -
install them first. You'll need the `node` and `npm` commands to build this
project and `mongod` running in the background to run the tests.

Downloading dependencies:

    npm install

Running tests:

    npm test
    npm run-script autotest


Running

Detecting the team size works automatically if you have PA Stats installed.
Otherwise you'll need to adjust it manually by clicking +/- in the UI.
