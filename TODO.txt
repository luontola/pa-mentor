OK - make it easier to switch the backend server to use when developing, maybe detect automatically whether it's running on localhost?

OK - reduce server load: store less history (14d), update less often (12h)

OK - show application version on index page

OK - save full game details
OK - remove old games from database
OK - use game.startTime when calculating relativeTime
OK - on save, check that game has required fields
OK - if update fails (e.g. due to http error), retry after one minute
OK - fetch games from oldest to newest (in order to avoid gaps if some fetches fail)
    OK - find out the newest game in database
    OK - fetch from that (minus update interval, batch size and max game length) upwards to current time
    OK - make the batch size smaller (e.g. 1 hour) to be nicer to the remote server
OK - make the updater smarter; don't to a analytics update on server start, but based on the last time when it was done
OK - save database version in database, run data migration (regeneration) on startup when necessary

OK - locate the outlier games in the statistics (an army of 1393 at time 0 is unrealistic)

OK - group games based on the number of players in the team

!! - wait for server to update itself
	- check that it has teamSize in http://pa-mentor.orfjackal.net/api/percentiles/0?teamSize=1
	- remove workaround from analytics.getPercentiles
- API for forcing an update
- if update triggered while one is running, return the existing promise
- figure out should 'value.timepoint' and 'value.teamSize' both be indexed, and should it be same or different indexes
- release 0.2.0

- filter games based on whether the player was in the winning team

- improve Mocha to support asynchronous tests that return a promise instead of using the callback

- use DI for stateful modules, then mock them in tests where applicable

- consider making the deploy process pull updates from github instead of them being pushed
    - this would avoid the need to push tags to show the version number
