- install on a server
    - install nginx
    - configure nginx to proxy apache
    - install nodejs
    - install mongodb
    - create startup script for pamentor
    - create subdomain
    - configure nginx to proxy nodejs
    - test that pamentor starts on reboot
- publish a mod that uses that server
    - figure out how to parameterize the URL
    - create release scripts

- fetch games from oldest to newest (in order to avoid gaps if some fetches fail)
    - find out the newest game in database
    - fetch from that (minus update interval and 1 day) upwards
- group games based on the number of players in the team
- filter games based on whether the player was in the winning team

- locate the outlier games in the statistics (an army of 1393 at time 0 is unrealistic)
