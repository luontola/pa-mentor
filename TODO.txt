OK - make it easier to switch the backend server to use when developing, maybe detect automatically whether it's running on localhost?

OK - reduce server load: store less history (14d), update less often (12h)

- fetch games from oldest to newest (in order to avoid gaps if some fetches fail)
    - find out the newest game in database
    - fetch from that (minus update interval and 1 day) upwards
- make the updater smarter; don't to a analytics update on server start, but based on the last time when it was done
- save database version in database, run data migration (regeneration) on startup when necessary
- remove old games from database

- group games based on the number of players in the team

- show application version on index page

- filter games based on whether the player was in the winning team

- locate the outlier games in the statistics (an army of 1393 at time 0 is unrealistic)
